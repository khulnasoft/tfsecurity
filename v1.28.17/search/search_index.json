Over the past year, tfsecurity has laid the foundations to Trivy's IaC & misconfigurations scanning capabilities, including Terraform scanning, which has been natively supported in Trivy for a long time now. Going forward we want to encourage the tfsecurity community to transition over to Trivy. Moving to Trivy gives you the same excellent Terraform scanning engine, with some extra benefits: Access to more languages and features in the same tool. Access to more integrations with tools and services through the rich ecosystem around Trivy. Commercially supported by KhulnaSoft as well as by a the passionate Trivy community. tfsecurity will continue to remain available for the time being, although our engineering attention will be directed at Trivy going forward. tfsecurity to Trivy migration guide For further information on how Trivy compares to tfsecurity and moving from tfsecurity to Trivy, do have a look at the migration guide. tfsecurity tfsecurity is a static analysis security scanner for your Terraform code. Designed to run locally and in your CI pipelines, developer-friendly output and fully documented checks mean detection and remediation can take place as quickly and efficiently as possible tfsecurity takes a developer-first approach to scanning your Terraform templates; using static analysis and deep integration with the official HCL parser it ensures that security issues can be detected before your infrastructure changes take effect.

We recognise that there are checks that need performing for an organisation that don't fit with general use cases; for this, there are custom checks. Custom checks offer an accessible approach to injecting checks that satisfy your organisations compliance and security needs. For example, if you require that all EC2 instances have a CostCentre tag, that can be achieved with a custom_check . How does it work? Custom checks are defined as json files which sit in the .tfsecurity folder in the root check path. any file with the suffix _tfchecks.json or _tfchecks.yaml will be parsed and the checks included during the run. Overriding check directory The default location for custom checks can be overridden, this is done using the --custom-check-dir to specify another location to load the checks from instead. This is useful when global checks are to applied to the terraform under test. Downloading remote check file A custom check file can be downloaded from remote locations using the --custom-check-url . This must be an HTTP location to a file with either a json or yaml extension tfsecurity --custom-check-url https://github.com/myorg/tfsecurityconfig/custom_tfchecks.json . What does a check file look like? Check files are simply json, this ensures that checks can be put together without requiring Go knowledge or being able to build a new release of tfsecurity to include your custom code. Taking the previous example of a required cost centre, the check file might look something like { \"checks\" : [ { \"code\" : \"CUS001\" , \"description\" : \"Custom check to ensure the CostCentre tag is applied to EC2 instances\" , \"impact\" : \"By not having CostCentre we can't keep track of billing\" , \"resolution\" : \"Add the CostCentre tag\" , \"requiredTypes\" : [ \"resource\" ], \"requiredLabels\" : [ \"aws_instance\" ], \"severity\" : \"ERROR\" , \"matchSpec\" : { \"name\" : \"tags\" , \"action\" : \"contains\" , \"value\" : \"CostCentre\" }, \"errorMessage\" : \"The required CostCentre tag was missing\" , \"relatedLinks\" : [ \"http://internal.acmecorp.com/standards/aws/tagging.html\" ] } ] } or --- checks : - code : CUS001 description : Custom check to ensure the CostCentre tag is applied to EC2 instances impact : By not having CostCentre we can't keep track of billing resolution : Add the CostCentre tag requiredTypes : - resource requiredLabels : - aws_instance severity : ERROR matchSpec : name : tags action : contains value : CostCentre errorMessage : The required CostCentre tag was missing relatedLinks : - http://internal.acmecorp.com/standards/aws/tagging.html Using go run ./cmd/tfsecurity-checkgen generate , you can generate a skeleton custom check file. The check contains up of the following attributes; Attribute Description code The custom code that your check will be known as description A description for the code that will be included in the output impact An optional detail about the consequences of not passing the check resolution An optional brief description of how to satisfy the check requiredTypes The block types to apply the check to - provider, resource, data, module, variable requiredLabels The resource type - aws_ec2_instance for example. This also supports wildcards using * , e.g. aws_* severity How severe is the check matchSpec See below for the MatchSpec attributes errorMessage The error message that should be displayed in cases where the check fails relatedLinks A list of related links for the check to be displayed in cases where the check fails Optionally, you can use your own provider name and service :warning: care should be taken not to mask existing checks. It is suggested that the provider shouldn't be one of the built in ones or should include the custom designator. Attribute Description provider The name of the service the custom check is addressing service The name of the service the custom check is addressing The MatchSpec is the what will define the check itself - this is fairly basic and is made up of the following attributes Attribute Description name The name of the attribute or block to run the check on action The check type - see below for more information value In cases where a value is required, the value to look for, text matching TFSECURITY_VAR_{VAR_NAME} will be replaced with the variable value ignoreUndefined If the attribute is undefined, ignore and pass the check preConditions An array of checks, performs the check action defined in action if all preConditions checks passes, passes the whole matchSpec if preConditions are not satisfied subMatch A sub MatchSpec block for nested checking - think looking for enabled value in a logging block, or checking a tag's value in a tag map attribute subMatchOne Same as subMatch, but looks for only exactly 1 match in nested checks, cannot be applied on subMatches for attributes predicateMatchSpec An array of MatchSpec blocks to be logically aggregated by either and or or actions assignVariable The name of the \"variable\" to store the value of the name attribute in, has to be in uppercase and start with TFSECURITY_VAR_ Check Actions There are a number of CheckActions available which should allow you to quickly put together most checks. inModule The inModule check action passes if the resource block is a component of a module. For example, if you're looking to check that an aws_s3_bucket is only created using a custom module, you could use the following MatchSpec ; \"matchSpec\" : { \"action\" : \"inModule\" } matchSpec : action : inModule isPresent The isPresent check action passes if the required block or attribute is available in the checked block. For example, if you're looking to check that an acl is provided and don't care what it is, you can use the following MatchSpec ; \"matchSpec\" : { \"name\" : \"acl\" , \"action\" : \"isPresent\" } matchSpec : name : acl action : isPresent notPresent Conversely, the noPresent check action passes if the specified block or attribute is not found in the checked block. For example, if you explicitly don't want an acl attribute to be present hou can use the following MatchSpec \"matchSpec\" : { \"name\" : \"acl\" , \"action\" : \"notPresent\" } matchSpec : name : acl action : notPresent isEmpty The isEmpty check action passes if the named block or attribute is defined by empty. For example, to check that there are not tags you might use the following MatchSpec \"matchSpec\" : { \"name\" : \"tags\" , \"action\" : \"isEmpty\" , } matchSpec : name : acl action : isEmpty startsWith The startsWith check action passes if the checked attribute string starts with the specified value. For example, to check that acl begins with public you could use the following MatchSpec \"matchSpec\" : { \"name\" : \"acl\" , \"action\" : \"startsWith\" , \"value\" : \"public\" } matchSpec : name : acl action : startsWith value : public endsWith The endsWith check action passes if the checked attribute string ends with the specified value. For example, to check that acl ends with read you could use the following MatchSpec ; \"matchSpec\" : { \"name\" : \"acl\" , \"action\" : \"endsWith\" , \"value\" : \"-read\" } matchSpec : name : acl action : endsWith value : -read contains The contains check action will change depending on the attribute or block it is applied to. If the check is against a string attribute, it will look for the MatchSpec value in the attribute. If the check is against a list, it will pass if the value item can be found in the list. If the attribute is an object or map it will pass if a key can be found that matches the MatchSpec value. For example, if you want to ensure that the CostCentre exists, you might use the following MatchSpec ; \"matchSpec\" : { \"name\" : \"tags\" , \"action\" : \"contains\" , \"value\" : \"CostCentre\" } matchSpec : name : tags action : contains value : CostCentre notContains The notContains check action will change depending on the attribute or block it is applied to. If the check is against a string attribute, it will look for the MatchSpec value in the attribute. If the check is against a list, it will pass if the value item can be found in the list. If the attribute is an object or map it will pass if a key can be found that matches the MatchSpec value. For example, you want to make sure that an action does not contain kms:* you might use the following MatchSpec : \"matchSpec\" : { \"name\" : \"action\" , \"action\" : \"notContains\" , \"value\" : \"kms:*\" } matchSpec : name : tags action : notContains value : kms:* onlyContains The onlyContains check action ensures that a slice value only contains acceptable values. For example. if you want to ensure that the tags only contain CostCentre and Environment you might use the following MatchSpec : \"matchSpec\" : { \"name\" : \"tags\" , \"action\" : \"onlyContains\" , \"value\" : [ \"Environment:prod\" , \"CostCentre:engineering\" ] ] } matchSpec : name : tags action : onlyContains value : - Environment:prod - CostCentre:engineering equals The equals check action passes if the checked attribute equals specified value. The core primitive types are supported, if the subject attribute is a Boolean, the MatchSpec value will attempt to be cast to a Boolean for comparison. For example, to check that acl begins with private you could use the following MatchSpec ; \"matchSpec\" : { \"name\" : \"acl\" , \"action\" : \"equals\" , \"value\" : \"private\" } matchSpec : name : acl action : equals value : private lessThan The lessThan check action passes if the checked attribute is numerical and the value is less than the specified value. For example, if you want to ensure that the cpu_core_count is less than 8, you might use the following MatchSpec \"matchSpec\" : { \"name\" : \"cpu_core_count\" , \"action\" : \"lessThan\" , \"value\" : 8 } matchSpec : name : cpu_core_count action : lessThan value : 8 lessThanOrEqualTo The lessThanOrEqualTo check action passes if the checked attribute is numerical and the value is less than or equal to the specified value. For example, if you want to ensure that the cpu_core_count is less than or equal to 4, you might use the following MatchSpec \"matchSpec\" : { \"name\" : \"cpu_core_count\" , \"action\" : \"lessThanOrEqualTo\" , \"value\" : 4 } matchSpec : name : cpu_core_count action : lessThanOrEqualTo value : 4 greaterThan The greaterThan check action passes if the checked attribute is numerical and the value is greater than the specified value. For example, if you want to ensure that the cpu_core_count is greater than 2, you might use the following MatchSpec \"matchSpec\" : { \"name\" : \"cpu_core_count\" , \"action\" : \"greaterThan\" , \"value\" : 2 } matchSpec : name : cpu_core_count action : greaterThan value : 2 greaterThanOrEqualTo The greaterThanOrEqualTo check action passes if the checked attribute is numerical and the value is greater than or equal to the specified value. For example, if you want to ensure that the cpu_core_count is greater than or equal to 4, you might use the following MatchSpec \"matchSpec\" : { \"name\" : \"cpu_core_count\" , \"action\" : \"greaterThanOrEqualTo\" , \"value\" : 4 } matchSpec : name : cpu_core_count action : greaterThanOrEqualTo value : 4 regexMatches The regexMatches check action passes when the regex is matched to the pattern passed in the value. This is check would generally be used as a top level check to filter whether or not to apply a check. For example, this check will ensure that the source attribute of a module matches the supplied regex before continuing with the subMatches. This can be used to ensure that checks are targeted to specific modules. When tackling this specific use case of filtering module blocks by source, the requiredLabels should be set to \"*\" \"matchSpec\" : { \"name\" : \"source\" , \"action\" : \"regexMatches\" , \"value\" : \"^modules\\\\/.*public_.+bucket$\" , \"subMatch\" : { \"name\" : \"acl\" , \"action\" : \"equals\" , \"value\" : \"public-read\" } } matchSpec : name : source action : regexMatches value : \"^modules\\\\/.*public_.+bucket$\" subMatch : name : acl action : equals value : public-read isAny The isAny check action passes when the attribute value can be found in the slice passed as the check value. This check action supports strings and numbers \"matchSpec\" : { \"name\" : \"acl\" , \"action\" : \"isAny\" , \"value\" : [ \"private\" , \"log-delivery-write\" ] } matchSpec : name : acl action : isAny value : - private - log-delivery-write isNone The isNone check action passes when the attribute value cannot be found in the slice passed as the check value. This check action supports strings and numbers \"matchSpec\" : { \"name\" : \"acl\" , \"action\" : \"isNone\" , \"value\" : [ \"authenticated-read\" , \"public-read\" ] } matchSpec : name : acl action : isNone value : - authenticated-read - public-read requiresPresence The requiresPresence checks that the resource in name is also present in the Terraform code. If you wanted to ensure that aws_vpc_flowlogs is present if there is a aws_vpc , you might use the following matchSpec : \"matchSpec\" : { \"action\" : \"requiresPresence\" , \"name\" : \"aws_vpc_flowlogs\" } matchSpec : name : aws_vpc_flowlogs action : requiresPresence and The and check action passes when all the blocks provided within predicateMatchSpec evaluate to true . This action can be combined with subMatch to perform composite checks against the contents of nested blocks. Note that or and and actions can be nested as many times as needed. If you wanted to ensure that device_name and encrypted are both present in a nested ebs_block_device block, you might use the following matchSpec : \"matchSpec\" : { \"action\" : \"isPresent\" , \"name\" : \"ebs_block_device\" , \"subMatch\" : { \"action\" : \"and\" , \"predicateMatchSpec\" : [ { \"action\" : \"isPresent\" , \"name\" : \"device_name\" }, { \"action\" : \"isPresent\" , \"name\" : \"encrypted\" } ] } } matchSpec : action : isPresent name : ebs_block_device subMatch : action : and predicateMatchSpec : - action : isPresent name : device_name - action : isPresent name : encrypted or The or check action passes when at least one of the blocks provided within predicateMatchSpec evaluates to true . This action can be combined with subMatch to perform composite checks against the contents of nested blocks. Note that or and and actions can be nested as many times as needed. If you want to ensure that virtualization_type is assigned to either hvm or paravirtual , while enforcing that their implicitly linked required attributes are also present, you might use the following matchSpec : \"matchSpec\": { \"action\": \"or\", \"predicateMatchSpec\": [ { \"action\": \"and\", \"predicateMatchSpec\": [ { \"name\": \"virtualization_type\", \"action\": \"equals\", \"value\": \"hvm\" } ] }, { \"action\": \"and\", \"predicateMatchSpec\": [ { \"name\": \"virtualization_type\", \"action\": \"equals\", \"value\": \"paravirtual\" }, { \"name\": \"image_location\", \"action\": \"isPresent\" }, { \"name\": \"kernel_id\", \"action\": \"isPresent\" } ] } ] } matchSpec : action : or predicateMatchSpec : - action : and predicateMatchSpec : - name : virtualization_type action : equals value : hvm - name : sriov_net_support action : isPresent - action : and predicateMatchSpec : - name : virtualization_type action : equals value : paravirtual - name : image_location action : isPresent - name : kernel_id action : isPresent not The not check action passes when the predicateMatchSpec evaluates to false . As an example, if you want to represent that a resource should not be included inModule you might use the following matchSpec : \"matchSpec\": { \"action\": \"not\", \"predicateMatchSpec\": [ { \"action\": \"inModule\" } ] } matchSpec : action : not predicateMatchSpec : - action : inModule How do I know my JSON is valid? We have provided the tfsecurity-checkgen binary which will validate your check file or help perform tests to ensure that it is valid for use with tfsecurity . tfsecurity-checkgen validate Validates the syntax of a custom check. ```shell script go run ./cmd/tfsecurity-checkgen validate example/custom/.tfsecurity/custom_checks.json ### `tfsecurity-checkgen test-check` Tests custom check against provided test cases.

This is a useful feature if your organisation needs to implement custom security policies on top of avoid other misconfigurations and enforcing best practice guidelines. Example Policy package custom.aws.s3.no_insecure_buckets import data.lib.result deny[res] { bucket := input.aws.s3.buckets[_] bucket.name.value == \"insecure-bucket\" msg := \"Bucket name should not be 'insecure-bucket'\" res := result.new(msg, bucket.name) } Let's break this down. The package (line #1) must always start with the custom namespace in order for tfsecurity to recognise it. The rest of the package name can be whatever you like, but it's generally a good idea to break things down by cloud provider, service, environment etc. The name of the deny rule is important. Rule names must either be deny , or begin with deny_ in order to highlight an issue when tfsecurity runs. The input variable contains cloud resources organised by provider (e.g aws ), and then service (e.g. s3 ). You can see what this looks like by running tfsecurity on your project with the --print-rego-input flag. Combining this with the jq tool is very helpful: tfsecurity --print-rego-input | jq '.aws.s3.buckets[0].name' { \"endline\": 3, \"explicit\": true, \"filepath\": \"/home/liamg/rego-playground/terraform/bucket.tf\", \"managed\": true, \"startline\": 3, \"value\": \"secure-bucket\" } For more information about the input structure, you can review the entire schema in code form by studying the state.State Go struct defined in the defsec source code . All property names are converted to lower-case for consistency, to make writing policies easier. You may have noticed that the policy checks bucket.name.value , instead of just bucket.name . This is because the bucket.name property contains more than just the value of the property, it also contains various metadata about where this property value was defined, including the filename and line number of the source Terraform file. You can see an example of this metadata in the jq output above. The res object which is returned should be created with the result.new() function. This is the magic that ensures line numbers and file numbers can be reported when a policy fails. The function takes two parameters: msg This parameter is a string which explains the specific issue which has been encountered, e.g. MFA is not enabled for this user source This parameter is the property or object where the problem was encountered. If you are writing a policy which has no meaningful source parameter/object, you can return a simple string from the rule instead. Applying Rego Policies You can ask tfsecurity to apply your custom Rego policies by using the --rego-policy-dir flag to specify the directory containing your policies. Policies will be loaded recursively starting at this directory, and so can be organised using nested subdirectories if desired. If this flag is not specified, no local directories will be scanned for rego policies.","title":"Writing Custom Rego Policies"},{"location":"guides/rego/rego/#example-policy","text":"package custom.aws.s3.no_insecure_buckets import data.lib.result deny[res] { bucket := input.aws.s3.buckets[_] bucket.name.value == \"insecure-bucket\" msg := \"Bucket name should not be 'insecure-bucket'\" res := result.new(msg, bucket.name) } Let's break this down.

Rule names must either be deny , or begin with deny_ in order to highlight an issue when tfsecurity runs. The input variable contains cloud resources organised by provider (e.g aws ), and then service (e.g. s3 ). You can see what this looks like by running tfsecurity on your project with the --print-rego-input flag. Combining this with the jq tool is very helpful: tfsecurity --print-rego-input | jq '.aws.s3.buckets[0].name' { \"endline\": 3, \"explicit\": true, \"filepath\": \"/home/liamg/rego-playground/terraform/bucket.tf\", \"managed\": true, \"startline\": 3, \"value\": \"secure-bucket\" } For more information about the input structure, you can review the entire schema in code form by studying the state.State Go struct defined in the defsec source code . All property names are converted to lower-case for consistency, to make writing policies easier. You may have noticed that the policy checks bucket.name.value , instead of just bucket.name . This is because the bucket.name property contains more than just the value of the property, it also contains various metadata about where this property value was defined, including the filename and line number of the source Terraform file. You can see an example of this metadata in the jq output above. The res object which is returned should be created with the result.new() function. This is the magic that ensures line numbers and file numbers can be reported when a policy fails. The function takes two parameters: msg This parameter is a string which explains the specific issue which has been encountered, e.g. MFA is not enabled for this user source This parameter is the property or object where the problem was encountered. If you are writing a policy which has no meaningful source parameter/object, you can return a simple string from the rule instead.","title":"Example Policy"},{"location":"guides/rego/rego/#applying-rego-policies","text":"You can ask tfsecurity to apply your custom Rego policies by using the --rego-policy-dir flag to specify the directory containing your policies. Policies will be loaded recursively starting at this directory, and so can be organised using nested subdirectories if desired. If this flag is not specified, no local directories will be scanned for rego policies.","title":"Applying Rego Policies"}]}
